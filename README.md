## Text-to-Music Generation in Google Colab

### Introduction
This project explores how to generate music from text using deep learning. By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) models and MIDI processing libraries, we can map textual descriptions into musical compositions. The goal is to take a text prompt (e.g., "A calm and peaceful melody") and generate a MIDI sequence that represents the sentiment and theme of the input.

### Steps in This Notebook
1. **Install Dependencies** – Install required Python libraries such as `torch`, `transformers`, `magenta`, `mido`, and `pretty_midi`.
2. **Load a Pre-trained NLP Model** – Use a GPT-2 model to process and interpret the input text.
3. **Convert Text to MIDI Notes** – Map characters from the generated text to MIDI note values.
4. **Generate a MIDI File** – Create a MIDI sequence from the notes and export it as a file.
5. **Playback & Experimentation** – Modify the text input to generate different musical outputs.
